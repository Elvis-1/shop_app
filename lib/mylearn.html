<!--
To use the provider packaged that was installed import 'package:provider/provider.dart';
 The provider package is needed to manage states of different files. Add the package to a file above where its needed.
 For example, productViewScreen needs the products in the provider, and productViewScreen is registered in main, add the provider class to main
I faced this problem:
The argument type 'Widget?' can't be assigned to the parameter type 'Widget'., To solve i add '!' i.e child:ch!
 ListView can't be used directly in a column, Use Expanded instead, expanded takes the availble space.

 ISSUE
 Because CartItem was repeated, we had the error: CartItem' isn't a function.
 To solve, we imported it as import '../widget/cart_item.dart' as ci; and added it sd ci.CartItem
