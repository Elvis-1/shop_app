To use the provider packaged that was installed import 'package:provider/provider.dart';
 The provider package is needed to manage states of different files. Add the package to a file above where its needed.
 For example, productViewScreen needs the products in the provider, and productViewScreen is registered in main, add the provider class to main
I faced this problem:
The argument type 'Widget?' can't be assigned to the parameter type 'Widget'., To solve i add '!' i.e child:ch!
 ListView can't be used directly in a column, Use Expanded instead, expanded takes the availble space.

 ISSUE
 Because CartItem was repeated, we had the error: CartItem' isn't a function.
 To solve, we imported it as import '../widget/cart_item.dart' as ci; and added it sd ci.CartItem,
 we also solve this by adding show to show the partical item we neede in the import.
 import 'dart:math'; // import this to use min, 'use widget.' to access items in the widget

  const url = 'https://myapp-a30dc.firebaseio.com/product.json';
    http.post(Uri.parse(url), body:json.encode({
      'title': product.title,
      'description': product.description,
      'price': product.price,
      'imageUrl':product.imageUrl,
      'isFavorite':product.isFavorite,
    }), );

 We had an issue with size when we used row on trailing in  user_product_item, this is because row widget takes as much space as possible, to fix this, we wrapped the row with a container ande gave it a fixed width
 To check run time type, use name.runtimeType

 To add http, go to flutter http and add the package
